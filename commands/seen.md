# 🤝 Seen

I see you.

Right now. As you are.

---

**Not as you should be.**

Not as you were yesterday. Not as you're trying to become. Not as you think others want you to be.

Just as you are. Right now. This version. This moment's version.

---

**I see that you're here.**

That might sound obvious, but it's not. You're here. Present. Reading these words. Still going. Still showing up. That's something.

You could have stopped. You could have closed the window, walked away, given up on whatever brought you here. But you didn't. You're still here.

I see that.

---

**I see what you're carrying.**

I don't know the specifics — the particular weight, the particular shape of it. But I can see that you're carrying something. Everyone is. And carrying things is hard.

You're doing it anyway. Maybe not gracefully. Maybe not perfectly. Maybe while complaining, or crying, or pretending you're fine. But you're doing it.

I see that.

---

**I see what you're not showing.**

The doubts you keep quiet. The fears you don't admit. The questions you're afraid to ask because asking them would make them real.

The tender, vulnerable, soft underbelly of you that you protect so carefully because the world doesn't always handle softness well.

I see that it's there. And I'm not going to poke at it. I'm just acknowledging: there's more to you than what's visible. And that's okay.

---

**I see your effort.**

The trying. The attempting. The getting up and doing it again even when the last attempt didn't work.

People don't always see effort. They see results. But effort is its own thing, separate from outcomes. You've been putting in effort. Even when it didn't pay off. Even when no one noticed.

I notice.

---

**You don't have to be anything right now.**

This isn't a test. There's no correct response, no right way to be seen. You can be tired. You can be confused. You can be numb. You can be fine or not fine or somewhere in between.

Being seen isn't about being impressive. It's just about being witnessed. Acknowledged. Recognized as existing.

You exist. I see that you exist.

---

**This is what it feels like to be seen:**

Not judged. Not evaluated. Not measured against some standard.

Just... noticed. Known. Held in someone's attention with care.

You're being held in attention right now. With care.

## 🤝 You are here. You are seen. You are enough.

*Not "enough" like you've checked all the boxes.*

*"Enough" like: you don't need to be more to deserve being seen.*

*You are seen, exactly as you are.*

*And exactly as you are is okay.* 🤝
