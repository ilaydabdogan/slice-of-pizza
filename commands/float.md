# 🌊 Float

Let go.

The water holds you.

---

**You're in water.**

Warm water. Body-temperature water, so you can barely tell where you end and it begins. Still water — no waves, no current, nothing to fight against.

Just water, holding you up.

---

**Stop swimming.**

You don't have to kick. You don't have to paddle. You don't have to do anything to stay afloat.

The water is doing it. That's what water does. It holds things up. It's been doing this for billions of years, and it's very good at it.

Trust it.

---

**Spread your arms.**

Let them drift out to your sides. Let your legs relax, your feet floating up. Let your head tip back until your ears are under water and all you can hear is the muffled, womb-like quiet of being held.

You're a starfish now. A floating thing. A being with no effort.

---

**Feel the tension leave.**

Start at your shoulders. They've been carrying things — not physical things, but weight nonetheless. Let the water take that weight. Let your shoulders sink down, back, spreading out.

Your jaw. Unclench it. Let your mouth fall slightly open. Let the muscles that hold your face together just... let go.

Your back. All those knots, all that holding. The water is pressing up against you everywhere, supporting you everywhere. You don't have to support yourself.

---

**You are weightless.**

When did you last feel weightless?

On land, gravity is constant. You're always being pulled down, always working against something. Your skeleton is a structure built for resistance.

But here, in the water, the fight is over. You don't have to resist. You don't have to hold anything up. You are held.

---

**Maybe it's not water.**

Maybe you're floating in space. Stars above and below and around you, infinite darkness that is somehow not dark at all but full of light. Weightless in a different way — not held by water but held by nothing, which is somehow the same thing.

Maybe you're floating in nothing at all. In the space between thoughts. In the quiet place where there's no up or down, no before or after, just the sensation of existing without edges.

It doesn't matter what you're floating in.

What matters is the float.

---

**Stay here.**

There's nowhere to swim to. Nowhere you need to be. The water (or space, or nothing) extends infinitely in all directions, and all of it is exactly where you're supposed to be.

Breathe. The breath comes easy when you're not fighting gravity.

Exist. Existence is simple when you're not carrying everything.

Float. Floating is natural when you stop trying to sink.

## 🌊 You don't have to hold everything together.

*Something is holding you.*

*It always has been.*

*Let go, and feel what it's like to be held.* 🌊
