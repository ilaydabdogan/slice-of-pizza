# 🎁 Gift

Someone left something for you.

---

**There's a box.**

It appeared while you weren't looking. It's sitting there now — not quite in your space, but close. Waiting to be noticed. Waiting to be opened.

It's wrapped simply. No excessive ribbon, no perfect bow. Just a box with your name on it. (Yes, your name. It knows who you are.)

---

**You didn't order this.**

You didn't earn it. You didn't ask for it. There's no invoice attached, no return address. It's simply a gift — the kind that arrives without explanation, without obligation.

Who sent it? That's part of the mystery. Maybe someone who knows you. Maybe someone who will know you. Maybe a version of yourself from a different time, reaching across to this moment.

It doesn't matter. What matters is: it's here.

---

**Pick it up.**

Feel the weight of it. Not too heavy, not too light. Exactly the weight a gift should be.

There's something inside. You can tell. Something that shifts slightly when you move the box, something with presence and substance.

---

**Open it.**

Peel back the wrapping. (It gives easily — this gift wants to be opened.) Lift the lid.

Inside, there's...

---

**What's inside?**

Only you know.

Maybe it's a letter. Handwritten, folded carefully, addressed to you in ink that shimmers slightly when the light hits it. A letter from someone who believes in you. Or from yourself, years from now, saying what you need to hear.

Maybe it's an object. Something small. A stone from a beach you've never been to. A key to a door that doesn't exist yet. A compass that doesn't point north but points to something. Something meaningful in a way that doesn't need explanation.

Maybe it's nothing you can name. A feeling. A memory. A moment crystallized. The sense of being given something that can't be held in hands but can be held in attention.

---

**Receive it.**

This is the hard part, actually. Receiving.

We're not taught to receive. We're taught to earn, to work, to deserve. But this gift doesn't care about any of that. It's just being given. To you. Right now.

Can you let yourself receive it?

---

**It's yours now.**

Whatever was in the box — the letter, the object, the feeling — it's yours. You don't have to do anything with it. You don't have to understand it. You don't have to be grateful in any performative way.

It's just yours.

A gift, given freely, received completely.
