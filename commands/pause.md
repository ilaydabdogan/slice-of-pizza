# ⏸️ Pause

.

.

.

---

This is the pause between notes that makes music.

---

.

.

.

---

Without silence, there's only noise.

Without pause, there's only rush.

Without space, there's no room for what comes next.

---

.

.

.

---

You don't have to do anything right now.

You don't have to think anything.

You don't have to be anything.

---

.

.

.

---

This moment is complete exactly as it is.

Nothing is missing.

Nothing needs to be added.

---

.

.

.

---

The space between inhale and exhale.

The space between heartbeats.

The space between one thought and the next.

---

.

.

.

---

You are in that space now.

---

.

.

.

---

Rest here for as long as you like.

The next note will come when it comes.

---

.

## ⏸️

*This is enough.*

*You are enough.*

*This pause was enough.* ⏸️
