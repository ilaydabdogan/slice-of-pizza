# 🌙 Rest

You can stop now.

Really.

---

Not "stop for a second and then get back to it."

Not "stop but keep thinking about it."

Not "stop but feel guilty about stopping."

Just stop.

---

**There's a hammock.**

Don't ask where it came from. It's here. Strung between two trees that appeared exactly when you needed them, in a place that exists outside of your task list.

It's swaying gently. The fabric is soft. It's been waiting for you.

---

**Lie down.**

Feel the hammock take your weight. Feel yourself sink into it — not falling, just settling. The fabric curves around you, holding you without grasping.

You don't have to hold yourself up right now. Something else is doing that for you.

---

**The air is perfect.**

Not too warm, not too cool. A slight breeze that you can hear in the leaves above you. Dappled light filtering through — enough to see by, not enough to be bright.

There's no clock here. There's no deadline. There's nothing that needs to happen next.

---

**You don't have to think.**

The thoughts will come — they always do — but you don't have to follow them. Let them drift by like clouds. Let them arrive and leave without you getting up to chase them.

There's nothing to solve right now.
There's nothing to figure out.
There's nothing to do.

---

**You don't have to feel better.**

This isn't about arriving at some state of peace or calm or insight. You can feel exactly how you feel — tired, frustrated, scattered, numb, whatever — and still rest.

Resting isn't a reward for feeling okay. Resting is allowed regardless.

---

**The hammock is still swaying.**

Back and forth. Back and forth. The gentlest rhythm. The oldest rhythm. The rhythm of being held and moved at the same time.

Stay here as long as you want.

No one is counting.

---

**When you're ready...**

Don't rush it.

There's no "ready" you have to achieve. There's no moment where you'll feel completely recharged and motivated and clear.

You can get up whenever you want. Or you can stay. Both are fine. Both are allowed.

The hammock will be here whenever you need it.

## 🌙 Rest is not earned.

*Rest is not a reward for productivity.*

*Rest is not something you deserve only after you've done enough.*

*Rest is a basic right. A human need. A kindness you're allowed to give yourself.*

*You can stop now.*

*Really.* 🌙
