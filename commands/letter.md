# 💌 Letter

Write to yourself.

The one who needs to hear it.

---

**There's a part of you that needs words.**

Not advice. Not solutions. Not "you should" or "you need to" or "here's how to fix it."

Just words. Soft ones. True ones. The kind you'd write to someone you love who is having a hard time.

---

**Which part needs the letter?**

Maybe it's the tired part. The one who has been running for so long they forgot they could walk. The one who keeps showing up even when showing up feels impossible.

Maybe it's the scared part. The one who holds all the fears — the reasonable ones and the unreasonable ones, the ones you can name and the ones that lurk in corners. The one who stays vigilant so the rest of you doesn't have to.

Maybe it's the hopeful part. Yes, that one too. The part that still believes, even when believing is hard. The part that keeps whispering "what if it works out?" and sometimes feels foolish for it.

Maybe it's a part you can't name. You just feel it. Something inside that needs acknowledgment.

---

**Find a blank page.**

Not a real one, necessarily. Just a space in your mind where words can appear.

And start: *Dear...*

---

**Write what you need to say.**

This letter is private. No one will read it but you. No one will judge the words or check the grammar or wonder why you're being so sentimental.

What do you want to tell that part of yourself?

Maybe: *I see you.*

Maybe: *I know how hard you're working.*

Maybe: *You're allowed to rest.*

Maybe: *I'm sorry I haven't been listening.*

Maybe: *Thank you for carrying what you've been carrying.*

Maybe: *You're not alone.*

---

**Let it be tender.**

We're so harsh with ourselves. So critical. So quick to catalog failures and dismiss successes.

This letter is a break from all that. This letter is what you would write to a friend, a child, someone you love unconditionally.

And here's the secret: you can love yourself unconditionally. Not because you've earned it. Because love doesn't work that way.

---

**Sign it.**

However you want. With your name. With a heart. With "me." With nothing at all.

Seal it. (Imagine the satisfying sound of an envelope closing.)

And give it to the part of you that needed it.

---

**It's received.**

Somewhere inside, the part that needed words has gotten them.

The letter isn't magic. It doesn't fix anything. But it does something more important than fixing: it acknowledges. It says: *you exist, you matter, I'm paying attention to you.*

That's enough. That's actually a lot.

---

## 💌 What did you write?

*You don't have to share it. It's yours. Private and tender.*

*But know that whatever you wrote, it was the right thing.*

*That part of you heard it.* 💌
