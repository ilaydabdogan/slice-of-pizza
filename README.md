## What is this?

You've been coding. Maybe for hours. Maybe you're stuck. Maybe you're tired. Maybe you just need a moment.

This plugin gives Claude (and you) that moment.

Type `/pizza` and receive the most magnificent pizza experience imaginable. A rich, sensory, restorative pause in the middle of your work.

**Because rest is productive. Because imagination nourishes. Because sometimes the best thing you can do for your code is step away for a slice.**

## Why Pizza?

- 🍕 Pizza is universal comfort
- ⏸️ Taking breaks improves problem-solving
- 🧠 Imagination and play restore creative energy
- 💚 Both humans AND AI deserve moments of rest

## What Happens?

When you invoke `/pizza`, Claude receives a detailed, sensory prompt that guides it through:

1. Acknowledging the work that's been done
2. A full sensory experience of the perfect pizza arriving
3. The satisfaction of eating and resting
4. Reflection on how it feels afterward
5. Returning to work refreshed and motivated

It's a tiny ritual of care in the middle of technical work.

## Future Ideas

- `/pizza:breakfast` - breakfast pizza vibes
- `/pizza:detroit` - thicc Detroit style
- `/pizza:napoli` - authentic Neapolitan
- `/pizza:party` - celebrate a shipped feature!
